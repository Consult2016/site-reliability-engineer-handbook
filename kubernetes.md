### Learn the Kubernetes Key Concepts in 10 Minutes

In this post I will provide a brief explanation of the key concepts of Kubernetes. I will avoid using lengthy definitions, these are already available in the Kubernetes documentations. Rather, I will be using a few diagrams (some animated) and examples to explain these concepts. I found a few of the concepts difficult to fully grasp without a diagram (Service for example). Where appropriate I will also provide links to the Kubernetes documentations if you want to deep dive.

Letâ€™s start the clock.
