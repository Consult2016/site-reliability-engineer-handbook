# Df

df command (disk free) displays the amount of total and free disk space available on the mounted filesystems.
```
Syntax: df [options] [name]

How much GB of disk space is free on my system?
Use df -h as shown below. Option -h displays the values in human readable format (for example: K for Kb, M for Mb and G for Gb). In the sample output below, / filesystem has 17GB of disk space available and /home/user filesystem has 70GB available.
```
