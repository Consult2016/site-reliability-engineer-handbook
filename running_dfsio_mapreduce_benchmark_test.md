# Running DFSIO mapreduce benchmark test

###What is DFSIO?

DFSIO is part of the hadoop distribution and can be found in "hadoop-mapreduce-client-jobclient-*-tests.jar" for MR2.   There are two types of DFSIO tools but i will be discussing TestDFSIO only.  TestDFSIO is Distributed I/O Benchmark tool as per the help description below.  There are several options you can pass into the tool.

###Usage
|Option	|Description|
|--|--|
|-read | This must be run after executing TestDFSIO with write option. This reads the generated data from hdfs://namendoe:8020/benchmarks/TestDFSIO/io_data
|-write| This generates data based on file options and writes it to hdfs://namendoe:8020/benchmarks/TestDFSIO/io_data
|-append |Can be run after executing TestDFSIO with write option. Will append to existing data under hdfs://namendoe:8020/benchmarks/TestDFSIO/io_data
|-clean	|Removes all data generated by TestDFSIO under hdfs://namendoe:8020/benchmarks/TestDFSIO/io_data
|-nrFiles	|Number of files to generate within HDFS. This is also equivialvent to the number of map tasks that will get executed.
|-fileSize	|Genterate a file for each map task ( -nrFiles ) with this size. Example -nrFiles 10 -fileSize 250GB would generate 2500GB of data in HDFS cluster
|-resFile	|Path to local file system ( not hdfs ) where TestDFSIO will store the resutls for the test
|-bufferSize	|Buffer size in bytes for each map tasks when reading and writing IO. Defaults to 1000000bytes ( about 1MB )
