# Object Storage

Object Storage Summary
* Data is stored as objects in one large, scalable pool of storage
* Objects are stored with metadata – information about the object
* An Object ID is stored, to locate the data
* REST is the standard interface, simple commands used by applications
* Objects are immutable; edits are saved as a new object

#### Why Object Storage?

Massive Data Growth
Depending on which analyst firm you talk to, you will hear storage growth predictions that vary between 30x-40x for
the next decade. That means we will all be storing 30 to 40 times as much digital data ten years from now, compared
to today. At the same time, companies will only invest an additional 50% in personnel to manage their storage
infrastructures. This means that the average storage operator will have to manage 15-20 times as much storage a
decade from now. This will drive the need for storage platforms that require little management effort and scale out
to virtually unlimited capacities.

####Always Online
Much of that data growth is driven by the recent innovations in cloud and mobile computing. We already mentioned
Amazon S3, but there are also Google®, Facebook®, Apple® and several smaller public storage cloud offerings that set
a new level of expectations where all data needs to be available anywhere at anytime.
