# 8 Powerful Awk Built-in Variables â€“ FS, OFS, RS, ORS, NR, NF, FILENAME, FNR

This article is part of the on-going Awk Tutorial Examples series. Awk has several powerful built-in variables. There are two types of built-in variables in Awk.

1. Variable which defines values which can be changed such as field separator and record separator.

2. Variable which can be used for processing and reports such as Number of records, number of fields.

1. Awk FS Example: Input field separator variable.

Awk reads and parses each line from input based on whitespace character by default and set the variables $1,$2 and etc. Awk FS variable is used to set the field separator for each record. Awk FS can be set to any single character or regular expression. You can use input field separator using one of the following two options:

* Using -F command line option.
* Awk FS can be set like normal variable.
```
Syntax:

$ awk -F 'FS' 'commands' inputfilename

(or)

$ awk 'BEGIN{FS="FS";}'
```

* Awk FS is any single character or regular expression which you want to use as a input field separator.

* Awk FS can be changed any number of times, it retains its values until it is explicitly changed. If you want to change the field separator, its better to change before you read the line. So that change affects the line what you read.
