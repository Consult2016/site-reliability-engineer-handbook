# Graphite

In this article, I'll provide a guide to help through all of the steps involved in setting up a monitoring system using a Graphite stack.

###What We Will Cover

We will cover the following topics to set up our Graphite monitoring system:

1. Introduction to Carbon & Whisper
2. Whisper Storage Schemas & Aggregations
3. Graphite Webapp

###Prerequisites

First and foremost we need hardware on which to run the Graphite stack. For simplicity, I will be using Amazon Web Services EC2 hosts. However, feel free to use any type of computer that you might have laying around in your office or at home.

Specifications:

* Operating System: Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 6.5
* Instance Type: m3.xlarge
* Elastic Block Store (EBS) Volume: 250 GB
* Python Version: 2.6.6

###Introduction to Carbon & Whisper

Graphite is composed of multiple back-end and front-end components. The back-end components are used to store numeric time-series data. The front-end components are used to retrieve the metric data and optionally render graphs. In this article, I'll focus first on the back-end components: Carbon and Whisper.

Metrics can be published to a load balancer or directly to a Carbon process. The Carbon process interacts with the Whisper database library to store the time-series data to the filesystem.

**Install Carbon**

Carbon refers to a series of daemons that make up the storage backend of a Graphite installation. The daemons listen for time-series data using an event-driven networking engine called Twisted. The Twisted framework permits Carbon daemons to handle a large number of clients and a large amount of traffic with a low amount of overhead.

To install Carbon, run the following commands (assuming RHEL operating system):

```
# sudo yum groupinstall "Development Tools"
# sudo yum install python-devel
# sudo yum install git
# sudo easy_install pip
# sudo pip install twisted
# cd /tmp
# git clone https://github.com/graphite-project/carbon.git
# cd /tmp/carbon
# sudo python setup.py install
```

The /opt/graphite directory should now have the carbon libraries and configuration files:

```
# ls -l /opt/graphite
drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root 4096 May 18 23:56 bin
drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root 4096 May 18 23:56 conf
drwxr-xr-x. 4 root root 4096 May 18 23:56 lib
drwxr-xr-x. 6 root root 4096 May 18 23:56 storage
```

Inside the bin folder, youâ€™ll find the three different types of Carbon daemons.

* **Cache**: accepts metrics over various protocols and writes them to disk as efficiently as possible; caches metric values in RAM as they are received, and flushes them to disk on a specified interval using the underlying Whisper library.
* **Relay**: serves two distinct purposes: replication and sharding of incoming metrics.
* **Aggregator**: runs in front of a cache to buffer metrics over time before reporting them into Whisper.

###Install Whisper

Whisper is a database library for storing time-series data that is then retrieved and manipulated by applications using the create, update, and fetch operations.

To install Whisper, run the following commands:

```
# cd /tmp
# git clone https://github.com/graphite-project/whisper.git
# cd /tmp/whisper
# sudo python setup.py install
```

The Whisper scripts should now be in place:

```
# ls -l /usr/bin/whisper*
-rwxr-xr-x. 1 root root 1711 May 19 00:00 /usr/bin/whisper-create.py
-rwxr-xr-x. 1 root root 2902 May 19 00:00 /usr/bin/whisper-dump.py
-rwxr-xr-x. 1 root root 1779 May 19 00:00 /usr/bin/whisper-fetch.py
-rwxr-xr-x. 1 root root 1121 May 19 00:00 /usr/bin/whisper-info.py
-rwxr-xr-x. 1 root root  674 May 19 00:00 /usr/bin/whisper-merge.py
-rwxr-xr-x. 1 root root 5982 May 19 00:00 /usr/bin/whisper-resize.py
-rwxr-xr-x. 1 root root 1060 May 19 00:00 /usr/bin/whisper-set-aggregation-method.py
-rwxr-xr-x. 1 root root  969 May 19 00:00 /usr/bin/whisper-update.py
```

###Start a Carbon Cache Process

The Carbon installation comes with sensible defaults for port numbers and many other configuration parameters. Copy the existing example configuration files:
