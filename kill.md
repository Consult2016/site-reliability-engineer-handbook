# Kill

kill command is a command that is used to send a signal in order to request the termination of the process. 

We typically use kill -SIGNAL PID, where you know the
PID of the process.

* The kill() system call can be used to send any signal to any process group or process.
* int kill( pid_t pid, int signo );
