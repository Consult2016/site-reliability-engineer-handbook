# Githug – What is it?

Githug is an awesome program to help you improve your git skills. It contains several levels, that start off with some easy tasks and will go deeper with every level. At first you start with initializing a bare git repo, adding and committing files and configuring the .gitignore file. But then you get to remote repositories, stashing, rebasing, merging and reflogs. I found it very useful, to improve my knowledge about git and found myself reading the man files more often, getting to know some awesome details about git.

Githug is written in Ruby and maintained on Github. There are more levels to come, so my tutorial might be outdated by the time you read it. If you find any errors or missing levels, feel free to contact me.

###Installation

It is really easy to setup Githug. You can simply install it with the following command:

`gem install githug`

This should work on MacOS X and the common Linux distros. On Linux, you can simply use yum, apt-get or the packet-installation software, that your distro uses, to install gem.

###Solutions

As I had some trouble myself with some of those levels, I thought, that it might be helpful for other people to find a solution to the levels. I decided to make my solutions available, hoping they might help you. My approach of solving the levels might differ from your approach, but that’s the beauty of such problems. There often isn’t this one way to get things done. But without any further ado, here’s my solution.
