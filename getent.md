Administrative databases in Unix

As you can probably see from their names, the administrative databases are here to help you gather the most vital information about your environment:

* passwd – can be used to confirm usernames, userids, home directories and full names of your users
* group – all the information about Unix groups known to your system
* services – all the Unix services configured on your system
* networks – networking information – what networks your system belongs to
* protocols – everything your system knows about network protocols
