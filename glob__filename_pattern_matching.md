# glob â€“ Filename pattern matching

Even though the glob API is very simple, the module packs a lot of power. It is useful in any situation where your program needs to look for a list of files on the filesystem with names matching a pattern. If you need a list of filenames that all have a certain extension, prefix, or any common string in the middle, use glob instead of writing code to scan the directory contents yourself.

The pattern rules for glob are not regular expressions. Instead, they follow standard Unix path expansion rules. There are only a few special characters: two different wild-cards, and character ranges are supported. The patterns rules are applied to segments of the filename (stopping at the path separator, /). Paths in the pattern can be relative or absolute. Shell variable names and tilde (~) are not expanded.
